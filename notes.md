Homepage: click upcoming box of a class and modal with more details appears, you can join/attend/rsvp.
Homepage: under upcoming is a "Most requested" section with a filter and is 2 or 3 columns with a icon and thumbs up.
Teach: Select a category first, then list of requested courses appears, if you click on the requested course then the rest of the teach form appears, with the title prefilled out. You can change the title. There is a notice saying, X number of people have requested this class to show that you are fulfilling that request.
Request: This page should just be a modal that appears whenever "request a class" is clicked. Title, Category, and submit button are the only parts, then it should take them to the Requested page, sorted by "newest" so they see their post.
Requested: Have the URL be able to handle sorting and filtering. locallearners.net/#/requested?category=music&sort=popular
Upcoming Classes: URL to hand sorting and filtering. locallearners.net/#/classes?category=history&sort=oldest
